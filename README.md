A basic Sass framework, utilizing:
* Bourbon library of mixins (/bourbon folder)
* Bourbon Neat semantic grid (/neat folder)
* Normalize reset (/vendor folder)

The /base folder includes default styling for base elements and common modules. The _config partial has variables that should be customized for each site. 
 
This /base folder could be duplicated as a /theme folder, or left as is and appended with a /theme folder.
